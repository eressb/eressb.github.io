        I gotta testify <br>
        Come up in the spot looking extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky<br>
        Gotta testify<br>
        Come up in the spot looking extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky<br>
    </p>
   
    <p>
        Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc<br>
        Before Cam got the shit to pop<br>
        The doors was closed<br>
        I felt like Bad Boy's street team<br>
        I couldn't work the locks<br>
        Now let's go<br>
        Take 'em back to the plan<br>
        Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul Van<br>
        Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them<br>
        Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's take 'em back to the club<br>
        Least about an hour I stand on line<br>
        I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour<br>
        After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine<br>
        Jay favorite line, "Dawg, in due time"<br>
        Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg, you where I am"<br>
        A hip-hop legend<br>
        I think I died in that accident, 'cause this must be Heaven!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I gotta testify<br>
        Come up in the spot looking extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky<br>
        Gotta testify<br>
        Come up in the spot looking extra fly (yeah)<br>
        'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
        Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-igh<br>
        A-la-la-la-lah-la-la<br>
        (Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world)<br>
        Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-igh<br>
        A-la-la-la-lah-la-la<br>
        (Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world)<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
        Back when Gucci was the shit to rock<br>
        Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop<br>
        I'd do anything to say I got it<br>
        Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket<br>
        Before anybody wanted K. West beats<br>
        Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC<br>
        Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns<br>
        Like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
        Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane<br>
        And I don't know if I'll be back again<br>
        Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets<br>
        But when she came to kick it, things became different<br>
        Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on<br>
        Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long<br>
        I'm tryin' to right my wrongs<br>
        But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
    </p>
    <p>
        I gotta testify<br>
        Come up in the spot looking extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky<br>
        You gon' touch the sky, baby girl<br>
        Testify<br>
        Come up in the spot looking extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky<br>
    </p>
    <p>  
        Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?<br>
        Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd<br>
        Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb<br>
        Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup<br>
        Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth<br>
        But, before you say another word<br>
        I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
        I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra<br>
        But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde<br>
        Or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed<br>
        But I still feel possessed as a gun charge<br>
        Come as correct as a porn star<br>
        In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car<br>
        So, I represent the first<br>
        Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I gotta testify<br>
        Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky<br>
        You gon' touch the sky, baby girl<br>
        Testify<br>
        Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly<br>
        'Fore the day you die (yeah), you gon' touch the sky<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        We back at home, baby<br>
        Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!<br>
        I'm, I'm sky high<br>
        I'm, I'm sky high<br>
        I'm, I'm sky high<br>
        I'm, I'm sky high<br>
        Sky, sky high, I'm, I'm sky high<br>
        Yeah, keep it rollin'<br>
        Yeah<br>
        Uh, feels good to be home, baby<br>
